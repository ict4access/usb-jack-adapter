This code runs on Arduino Micro or compatible. Most important is being aware of the use of Keyboard library.
Please refer to Arduino [Mouse and Keyboard libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard).

Models supporting this feature are Leonardo, Micro, or Due.

The code allows you connect 2 jack inputs, however you can connect up to 9 jack inputs. 
Just add more pull up resistors and send proper key.
